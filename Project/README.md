   The account management system allows users to keep track of their active accounts, whether if its their emails, social media, or school accounts. When the project is executed, the first window that will pop up is a login form. Users must create an account for this application in order to efficiently organize their accounts in the Database by the specific application User. This also ensures that the accounts will remain secure in that users will not be able to view the stored accounts of other users. New users will be able to create their own accounts as long as their chosen usernames are not the same as a current user. 
   Once a user either creates a new account or logs in, they will be transferred to the mainframe, where all of the “action” happens. In this window, the users can access all of the fundamental features that make up the purpose of this application. Users can add their own personal accounts to the system, delete their accounts, update the password for their accounts, and view the accounts they have stored in the system. Even though there is a feature that allows a user to view all the accounts and info of every single user,  “Super-admins” are only allowed to access this feature. Finally, all users have the option to log out of their accounts where they would be transferred back to the login window of the Application.
